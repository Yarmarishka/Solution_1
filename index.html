		<p>Look into my eyes. You forgive me, I'm sorry. I love you! I was wrong. I'm sick of you. We couldn't hold it - we were tired, it was very difficult for us. I'm all alone, you understand-without love, nothing is needed.

        <p>My dreams without a soul. I miss you, everything has become complicated. It's raining in front of my eyes. Do not be silent, - call, without love it hurts me.I'm asking you to give in. Every day I'm heartbroken. Sometimes in a dream, come and take it away, don't look for another one.

		<p>Swans cannot live in separation. Wait, take your time. Do not say that the feelings are behind you, there is no way back. Swans cannot live in separation. Wait, take your time. Take me, quickly, warm my love-The love of tired swans.
